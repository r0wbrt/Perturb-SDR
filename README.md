# Software-Defined-Radio
Project Goal is to create a Software Defined Radio system that can be ported to embedded processors. The project also has an auxiliary role to make parts of the implementation portable to an FPGA. The final goal of the project is to make the SDR systems so simple to use that all a programmer has to do is use read and write calls along with specifing a couple of needed paramaters. The SDR systems will handle everything else including protocol, FEC, and lost packet handling. The system will primarly use 1,2,4,8PSK and 16QAM based modulation schemes, but OFDM might be added at a later date. All code is written with emphasis on performance and limited memory resources both in terms of ram and storage.
