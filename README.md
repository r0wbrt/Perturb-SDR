# Perturb SDR
A ambitious project to develop a simple and straigtfoward, 100% free, software defined radio written in c++. Auxillarly goals include porting the library to fixed point implementations to aid in porting to embeded platforms. Currently the library is under going haphazard development and the API is nowhere near stable. If you want something added, go ahead and contact me and I will see what I can do. If you have code that you want to add. If you are feeling strange and what to join the project then by all means email me and hopefully I can make use of your help. 

#Compiling
I have yet to write an cmake file to compile this whole project. I will write one eventually though it is not an top concern yet since there are not many inter-dependencies. 

#FAQ

**Why not just use GNU radio
Becuase I do not view the GNU license as free and I am using this project to teach myself DSP techniques, specifically Software Defined Radio. Also, I also have ambitious goals of porting parts of my code to ARM processors. Porting GNU radio to an fixed point implementation would require understanding their code and I am busy and already have too much to do.

**I want feature X
Then email me and I will consider if adding it fits within the libraries philisophy and if I have time and know how to do it.
